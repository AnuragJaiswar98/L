Aim: Write a program to do the following:
• Enter a vector u as a n-list
• Enter another vector v as a n-list
• Find the vector au+bv for different values of a and b
• Find the dot product of u and v
Source code:
import numpy as n
u=n.array((3,4,5))
v=n.array((1,2,7))
print('Vector u=',u)
print('Vector v=',v)
print('Enter the value of a and b')
a=input()
b=input()
p=n.dot(u,v)
print('Dot product of u and v ',p)
