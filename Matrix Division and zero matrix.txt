Aim: Write program in python for matrix division
Source code:
import numpy as np
arr1 = [2, 27, 2, 21, 23]
arr2 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print ("arr1 : ", arr1)
print ("arr2 : ", arr2)
out = np.divide(arr1, arr2)
print ("\n Output array : \n", out) 


Aim : Write a program for zero matrix.
Source code:
import numpy as np
np.zeros((3,4),dtype=int)
