Aim: Write a program to do the following:
(a) Enter a positive number N and find numbers a and b such that a2– b2= N
Source code:
n=36
a=9
b=4
print('The value of positive number N is:',n)
print('Factors of N are:',a,b)
x=(a+b)/2
y=(a-b)/2
print(x)
print(y)
p=x*x
q=y*y
print('The value of square of a and b:',p,q)
n=p-q
print(n)
